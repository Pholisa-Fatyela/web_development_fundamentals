# What is HTML?

## Welcome to HTML!

HTML stands for **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage.   
  
Unlike a scripting or programming language that uses scripts to perform functions, a markup language uses tags to identify content.   
  
Here is an example of an HTML tag:

`<p> I'm a paragraph </p>`   

{% embed url="https://codepen.io/Pholisa-Fatyela/pen/YBvZYo/" %}
