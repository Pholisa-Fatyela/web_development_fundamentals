# Head Tag

## The &lt;head&gt; Tag

Immediately following the opening HTML tag, you'll find the **head** of the document, which is identified by opening and closing head tags.   
  
The head of an HTML file contains all of the **non-visual elements** that help make the page work.

```text
<html>
 <head>â€¦</head>
</html>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The head section elements will be discussed later.
{% endhint %}
