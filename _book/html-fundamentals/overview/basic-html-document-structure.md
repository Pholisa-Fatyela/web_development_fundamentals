# Basic HTML Document Structure

## The &lt;html&gt; Tag

Although various versions have been released over the years, HTML basics remain the same.   
  
The structure of an HTML document has been compared with that of a sandwich. As a sandwich has two slices of bread, the HTML document has opening and closing HTML tags.   
  
These tags, like the bread in a sandwich, surround everything else:

**`<html>                                                                      .....                                                                       </html>`**

Everything in an HTML document is surrounded by the &lt;html&gt; tag.
